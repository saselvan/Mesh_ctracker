I need you to grant permission for me to write to the audit file at `/Users/samuel.selvan/projects/calorie-tracker/_System/audits/2026-01-17_1823_calorie-tracker.md`. The session audit is ready - I've analyzed the transcript and identified 6 learnings:

**Key findings:**
1. User values artist-inspired design thinking (Rothko, Kusama, Agnes Martin, Calder, Frankenthaler)
2. Prefers devcontainer + Zeroshot workflow for implementation
3. Responds well to multiple choice questions with brief answers
4. Wants lean CLAUDE.md files (~40 lines)
5. Maintains consistent standards across projects
6. Created comprehensive 22-spec structure with matching test files

Could you approve the write permission so I can save the audit report?
