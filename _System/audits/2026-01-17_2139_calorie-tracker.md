The audit report is ready to write. Here's the summary:

**Session Audit Complete for calorie-tracker (2026-01-17 21:39)**

I analyzed the session transcript and identified **8 learnings**:

| # | Learning | Action |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | User responds with terse letters/numbers to option menus | Add to CLAUDE.md |
| 2 | App is dual-purpose: real daily use + portfolio showcase | Add to CLAUDE.md |
| 3 | Prefers multi-session planning over rushing | Already in plan file |
| 4 | Zeroshot spec workflow validated | Add to CLAUDE.md |
| 5 | Deep interest in cross-domain artistic inspiration | Already documented |
| 6 | Design tokens system established | Reference in CLAUDE.md |
| 7 | Devcontainer reuse pattern | Already documented |
| 8 | CSS-only animations constraint | In plan file |

**Key Session Output:**
- 22-spec phased implementation plan
- Design token system (Warm Wellness palette)
- 7 implementation specs created
- Artistic inspiration mapping (Rothko, Turrell, Agnes Martin, Frankenthaler, Calder, Kusama)

**Recommendations:**
1. Update CLAUDE.md with 3 additions (interaction style, dual-purpose, Zeroshot workflow)
2. No TELOS updates needed (productive session, no failures)
