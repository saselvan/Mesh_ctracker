Session audit complete. I've analyzed the transcript from 2026-01-17 for the calorie-tracker project.

**Key findings:**

| # | Learning | Suggested Location |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | CLAUDE.md should be lean for simple projects | CLAUDE.md |
| 2 | Zeroshot spec approach: specs contain copy-paste-ready code | TELOS/STRATEGIES.md |
| 3 | Artistic inspiration patterns (Rothko, Calder, Kusama) | New domain file |
| 4 | Devcontainer preference | Already documented |
| 5 | Missing global CLAUDE.md guidelines | Needs attention |

**Notable observation:** The user expected CLAUDE.md quality guidelines to exist globally, but Claude couldn't find them. The "Stop and Capture Rule" in the sa-intel vault mentions capturing repeated explanations, but explicit guidelines for CLAUDE.md file structure appear to be missing.

**Session produced:** 22 design specs, test files, validation reports, and a dependency-graph implementation plan for a calorie tracker UI overhaul with artistic inspiration.

The audit report is ready to be written to `/Users/samuel.selvan/projects/calorie-tracker/_System/audits/2026-01-17_1926_calorie-tracker.md` once permission is granted.
