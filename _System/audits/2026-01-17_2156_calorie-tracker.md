# Session Audit: calorie-tracker
**Date:** 2026-01-17 21:56:16

## Session Summary

This was a long design and implementation session (~5 hours) that began with a CLAUDE.md quality evaluation request and transitioned into a full design workflow using the /design and /frontend-design skills. The session produced 22 specs, test files, validation reports, and implementation plans, culminating in code review fixes for phases 1-4 implementation.

## 5 Learnings Detected

1. **CLAUDE.md Quality: Lean Over Comprehensive** - Trimmed from 129→40 lines, removing checklists that belong in issues
2. **Zeroshot Container Workflow** - Write specs to implement files, copy to container, run with zeroshot
3. **Art-Inspired Design Language** - Rothko backgrounds, Agnes Martin spacing, Frankenthaler progress bars, Kusama celebrations
4. **CSS Theme Selector Bug** - Use `body.theme-morning::before` not `.theme-morning body::before`
5. **Build Verification Before Handoff** - Run npm run build before generating implementation specs

**Summary:**
- 2 suggested for project CLAUDE.md (calorie-tracker)  
- 2 suggested for TELOS (LEARNED.md, STRATEGIES.md)
- 0 for global CLAUDE.md (already documented)
