I've completed the session audit analysis. The file write requires permissions that haven't been granted yet.

**Session Audit Complete**

I identified 3 learnings from the calorie-tracker session:

1. **Art-Inspired UI Design** - User loves drawing inspiration from modern artists like James Turrell (favorite), Rothko, Ellsworth Kelly, Agnes Martin, and Frank Stella for UI design

2. **Skill Combination Workflow** - User proactively combines /design and /frontend-design skills for comprehensive UI improvements

3. **Brief Communication Style** - User responds to multiple choice with single letters (E, B, "B and D") rather than full descriptions

The audit file is ready to be written to `/Users/samuel.selvan/projects/calorie-tracker/_System/audits/2026-01-17_1733_calorie-tracker.md` once write permissions are granted.
